# Designing the Boundary

**Constitutive Markov-Blanket Inversion in Individual and Collective Drones**  
Luca M. Possati — V5.0

This repository is the complete computational companion to the paper. It asks whether a drone can do more than detect a Markov blanket: can it select interventions that **construct, stabilize, or transform** the causal organization that makes a blanket true?

*Representative successful frozen missions. Left: individual boundary construction. Right: collective boundary assembly through pooled evidence and bilateral action. The animation is generated from simulator records by `make_experiment_animation.py`.*

The implementation separates:

- `q_t(M)`: the agent's posterior over all 2,520 complete assignments of eight modules to internal, sensory, active, and external roles;
- `C_t`: the physical role map, drift matrix, precision vector, and unscreened links that generate trajectories.

A belief update changes only `q_t(M)`. A constitutive shield or routing action can change `C_t`.

## Two experiments

### Part I — individual boundary design

One drone learns its transition and intervention models online and scores motor and structural action jointly by expected free energy (EFE).

| Task | Constitutive | Diagnostic only |
|---|---:|---:|
| Construct | 95% | 0% |
| Stabilize | 95% | 0% |
| Transform | 100% | 0% |

Frozen evaluation: 20 paired seeds, six conditions, three tasks, 360 missions.

### Part II — collective boundary design

Two drones have complementary partial observations. They pool structural evidence into a group posterior and must issue matching design proposals. A unilateral proposal is causally inert. The collective blanket cuts across the two physical chassis.

| Task | Collective MB | Individual blankets | Equal-bandwidth communication |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Assemble | 80% | 25% | 0% |
| Repair | 90% | 15% | 0% |
| Reconfigure | 100% | 40% | 0% |

Frozen evaluation: 20 paired seeds, seven conditions, three tasks, 420 missions.

## What the model claims

Inside a declared state space and action repertoire, EFE-guided structural inference can be converted into causal boundary design. With distributed evidence and an irreducibly bilateral action rule, that logic can also constitute a task-relative group boundary whose maintenance improves strategic performance.

The collective result supports **operational collective individuation**, not the unrestricted ontological claim that two drones literally become one organism or person. Candidate modules, action types, communication topology, and the handshake institution are engineered. The simulator is linear-Gaussian and the hardware problem remains open.

## Design operations

- **Precision crafting** → selection, gating, routing, and calibration of sensory and active modules.
- **Curiosity sculpting** → structural perturbations selected through EFE.
- **Prediction embedding** → priors over complete role partitions and learned transition/intervention likelihoods.

## Reproducibility

Runs are deterministic conditional on seed. Every frozen output directory contains mission-level CSV, summaries, paired effects, metadata, and publication figures. The tests enforce the key discriminating invariants, including that unilateral collective action cannot alter the group boundary.
